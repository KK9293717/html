<h1>"Election Not About You": Rahul Gandhi On PM's "Abused 91 Times" Charge</h1
<p>Turuvekere: Reacting to the Prime Minister's charge that he was "abused 91 times", Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said Narendra Modi should understand that the Karnataka election was not about him.
Asking the Prime Minister to speak about the BJP government's work and future programmes for Karnataka, instead of talking about himself, the former AICC president took a dig at Prime Minister Modi's statement about verbal abuses hurled at him.

"You (Modi) come to campaign in Karnataka for elections but don't speak about Karnataka. You speak about yourself. You have to say what you did in Karnataka for the past three years. You also have to speak in your speeches about what you will be doing in the next five years, what will do for youth, education, health and to fight corruption," Mr Gandhi said.</p>
